# Netflix_Movies_And_TV_Shows_Clustering_-Unsupervised_ML-
This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine.

In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.

Initially i have start with understanding the dataset, then i clean the data to make analysis ready.

Explore the data and understand the behaviour of the same.

Then i have prepare the dataset for creating clusters by various parameters wherein i can remove stop words, white spaces numbers etc. so that i can get important words and based on that i shall form clusters.

Later i have used the silhouette method and k-means elbow method to find optimal number of clusters and built recommender system by cosine similarity and recommended top ten movies.
